## MS 263  - Data Analysis Techniques In Marine Science
### Homework 5

Due: Wednesday, March 16

#### Reading 

Included in the `reading` directory (and helpful for guiding interpretation of the data):

Juranek, L. W., Feely, R. A., Peterson, W. T., Alin, S. R., Hales, B., Lee, K., Sabine, C. L., and Peterson, J. (2009), A novel method for determination of aragonite saturation state on the continental shelf of central Oregon using multi‚Äêparameter relationships with hydrographic data, *Geophys. Res. Lett.*, 36, L24601, doi:10.1029/2009GL040778

#### Problems

[1. Python modules](1-workbook-modules.ipynb)

* This builds off the module tutorial in class.

[2. Least squares regression](2-workbook-least-squares-regression.ipynb)

* A multi-part question (a-i) on least squares regression. Create a model for aragonite saturation state based on oxygen only. Calculate and interpret relevant statistics.

[3-4. Multiple regression](3-4-workbook-multiple-regression.ipynb)

* Builds off the tutorial in class. You should be able to replace this with the same notebook you started in class.


__Submission format:__ Upload all new and modified files to your homework 5 Github repository.

__Grading criteria:__  Code runs without errors, functions can be effectively used later with other data sets, code gives correct output, good coding style (documentation, descriptive variable names, not repeating yourself), clear graphics (axis labels and units), and valid statistical interpretation.
